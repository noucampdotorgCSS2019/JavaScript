1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part2()``.  Modify the function ``part2()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	change the heading text to *Letterkenny Institute of Technology*

1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part3()``.  Modify the function ``part3()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	change the text in the second paragraph to *We have campuses in Letterkenny and Killybegs.*


1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part4()``.  Modify the function ``part4()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	change the text in the third list item to *Email Us*


1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part5()``.  Modify the function ``part5()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	change the URL in the ``<a>`` to ``http://noucamp.org``

	Test it works.

1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part8()``.  Modify the function ``part8()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	use the ``getElementsByTagName()`` function to print the text of each paragraph.  Print to the console log window.

1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part9()``.  Modify the function ``part9()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	print to the console log the *value* associated with the currently selected item in the dropdown box.  E.g. you should be printing the value 2 for Green.

	Change the ``selected`` property to another colour and test again.


1.	In ``DOM.html`` uncomment the function call to ``part10()``.  Modify the function ``part10()`` in ``DOM.js`` to:

	-	initialise the text box with the text "input name"
